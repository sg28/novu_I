 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { serve } from "@novu/framework/express";
 * import { myWorkflow } from "./src/novu/workflows"; // Your workflows
 *
 * // Important:  ensure you add JSON middleware to process incoming JSON POST payloads.
 * app.use(express.json());
 * app.use(
 *   // Expose the middleware on our recommended path at `/api/novu`.
 *   "/api/novu",
 *   serve({ workflows: [myWorkflow] })
