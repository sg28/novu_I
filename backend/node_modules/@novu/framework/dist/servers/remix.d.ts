 * In Remix, serve and register any declared workflows with Novu, making them

 *
 * Remix requires that you export both a "loader" for serving `GET` requests,
 * and an "action" for serving other requests, therefore exporting both is
 * required.
 *
 * See {@link https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/resource-routes}
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { serve } from "@novu/framework/remix";
 * import { myWorkflow } from "./src/novu/workflows";
 *
 * const handler = serve({ workflows: [myWorkflow] });
 *
 * export { handler as loader, handler as action };
 * ```
